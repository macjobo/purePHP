<h1>CROSS: Consulting</h1>
<h2>Improve the use of your CROSS with the regular assistance and training provided by your POI CROSS consultant.</h2>

<p>During the implementation and support of CROSS, your POI CROSS consultant has helped your acquire the necessary basic and specialist know-how needed to implement and support CROSS in your dealer organisation. 
</p>

<p>However, an important factor for your support from POI is the <b>regular assistance and training</b> provided  by your POI CROSS consultant with his specialist knowledge. In particular during a release change, training in program changes and alterations to business processes is essential. Simply studying the release descriptions is generally insufficient.<br />
<b>POI CROSS consultants</b> can bring business processes to life for you, explaining them with examples. At the same time you will revise and refresh your knowledge of existing CROSS processes and applications. You will profit from sharing experiences with your CROSS consultant, enhancing your procedural knowledge, thereby achieving lasting benefits for your daily business. 
</p>

<p>To provide you with optimal consultancy, an <b>agenda</b> containing your questions and topics is necessary. The POI CROSS consultant coordinates this agenda with you for each visit. 
</p>

<p>We impart the knowledge to you with which you can optimise your business processes, as well as saving time and increasing security when attending to your customers. We <b>recommend</b> that you take advantage of a CROSS seminar lasting a couple of days once per quarter or at least twice per year.</p>
 
<p>Please make regular use of the range of services offered by your POI CROSS consultant.
