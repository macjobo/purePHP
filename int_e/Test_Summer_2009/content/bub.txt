<h1>IT Infrastructure: Video conference system</h1>
<h2>Video conference systems to facilitate international communication.</h2>

<p>An important element of cooperation in projects is the regular coordination of project participants. Personal, direct conversation is unarguably the most important element. Communication via telephone / email may often suffice, but <b>non-verbal communication</b> often conveys vital information. Previously project members had to drive or fly to discuss important matters face-to-face.</p>

<p>The implementation of a <a href="index.php?page=bild_bub" title="video conference system"><b>&raquo;&nbsp;video conference system </b></a> brings the right people together around a single virtual table, almost entirely independently of their actual location, and minimises the amount of actual on-site meetings.</p>

<p>Since June 2009, POI in Bergheim has been using the system provided by <b>Lifesize</b> (<a href="http://www.lifesize.com">http://www.lifesize.com</a>) for communication with the VW factory. This product offers us the following <b>advantages</b>:</p> 
<ul>
<div><li>Considerable savings of travel costs and travel time </li></div>
<div><li>Project members can have personal conversations at any time </li></div>
<div><li>Fast reactions are possible in case of crises</li></div>
<div><li>Additional experts can be drawn upon as required</li></div>
<div><li>The facial expressions and gestures of the dialog partner enhance the atmosphere of the conversation and  improve communication</li></div>
<div><li>Simple and intuitive control and good image video and sound quality</li></div>
</ul>

<p>The video conference system is intended to be deployed in countries where large POI projects are currently in progress - currently Romania, Croatia and Serbia. 
The systems have been purchased by Porsche Informatik and are made available to these countries, as they currently have the greatest communications requirements. Local visits are still intended, but in particular briefer discussions can quickly be handled via video conference.
