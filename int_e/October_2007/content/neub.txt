<h1>Requirements databases: Process for new requirements</h1>
<h2>New requirements on Porsche Informatik software products via a dedicated database</h2>


<p>In order to structure and standardise the processes for the new requirements on these products, we request that you immediately start utilising the <a href="index.php?page=bild_neub" title="requirements database"><b>requirements database</b></a> for the respective Porsche Informatik software product.</p>

<p><b>Area of application</b><br>

The requirements database is a web-based Notes Database that supports the requirements management of our software products. The database makes the entire lifecycle of a specific requirement more transparent, from the compilation of the requirement to the approved solution. Moreover, the database facilitates the specification of a feasible solution for the respective client, and offers an overview of all existing requirements. In addition to this, the interaction between requester and product manager is thus facilitated.</p>

<p><b>Access</b><br>

You can access the requirements database via your Partner.Net by means of the existing Partner.Net password (Brand -> Porsche Informatik -> Product Requirements). In the case of countries or business areas which do not use Partner.Net, there is an access option via Lotus Notes Domino.</p>

<p><b>Compilation of a new requirement</b><br>

Click the <i>'New Requirement'</i> button after selecting the appropriate product. Fill in (as a minimum requirement) the fields <i>Topic, Requester, Responsible POI, Category, Country</i> and <i>Specification of Requirement</i>. Save the requirement by clicking the menu bar button <i>'Save and Close'</i>. This saves the requirement in the database and an email is sent to the employee responsible at Porsche Informatik.<br>
The following products already use a requirements database:</p>

<ul>
<li>CROSS</li>
<li>CARLOS</li>
<li>VU2</li>
<li>SPS</li>
<li>SABIS</li>
<li>Weltauto  [= Used car Internet marketplace]</li>
<li>Neuwagen Internet [= Internet marketplace for new cars]</li>	
<li>Partner.Net-Portal</li>	
<li>Service Desk Solution</li>	
</ul>

<p>As you will see from the explanation given above, it is really very easy to compile a new requirement! We would welcome many requirements via this database. Should you have any further questions or desire access to a requirements database, then please contact us.</p>
