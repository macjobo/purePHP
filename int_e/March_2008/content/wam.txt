<h1>Customer Care Center: The central Service Desk</h1>
<h2>The Porsche Informatik Customer Care Center has been the central Service Desk for our customer queries for almost seven years.</h2>

<p>The <b>"Single point of contact"</b> concept - a single central access point for an organisation - is useful for both the user and IT service provider. A central access point is easier for customers to use and saves them time. The data gained allows Porsche Informatik to better identify customer needs and serves as the basis for improvements of our products and services.</p>

<p>What exactly do we do for our customers? 

<ul>
<li><div><b>Customer support:</b> We receive customer queries and analyse them. If we can not immediately resolve a query, it is forwarded to the relevant specialists.</div></li>
<li><div><b>Escalation management:</b> To ensure quality, we check whether the agreed reaction-and solution times are being adhered to. Additionally we ensure that urgent support requests are dealt with in a timely fashion.</div></li>
<li><div><b>Problem management:</b> We point out repeated or frequently occurring problems and deal with special topics.</div></li>
</ul>
</p>
