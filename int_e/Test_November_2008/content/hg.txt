<h1>Partner.Net: NEW employee maintenance (Personenwartung NEU)</h1>
<h2>NEW employee maintenance (Personenwartung NEU) allows maintenance of employee and authorisation data in retail.</h2>

<p>The <b>initial scepticism</b> was great: "Will retailers accept the software solution, and manage the joining, leaving and change of roles of their employees themselves in Partner.Net?".</p>

<p>The <b>first year of deployment in Austria</b> has shown very positive results. Over 10,000 change notifications, including approx. 1300 employees joining, 7500 changes and 1600 employees leaving in the space of a year are a clear sign that retailers are happy to manage their employees in Partner.Net.</p>

<p>The previous, awkward <b>method for employee change</b>s was that they were reported to wholesale by telephone or email and which were then processed by wholesale staff. Except for the new staff joining the dealers, changes which a dealer inputs in "NEW employee maintenance" are executed immediately.</p> 

<p>The <b>high customisability</b> of "NEW employee maintenance" allows wholesale to define functions and tasks, which require the authorisation of the importer when being assigned to a person. In particular this could be important for the assignment of key functions such as executives or service managers.</p>

<p>Currently "NEW employee maintenance" is used in <b>Hungary</b> and <b>Austria</b>. Implementation is planned for Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania within the next months.</p>
