<h1>Support: CCC is becoming the Service Desk</h1>
<h2>The Customer Care Center is becoming the "Service Desk", and from 1 December 2008 the new Online Support will be deployed!</h2>

<p>"Welcome to the  Porsche Informatik Service Desk!" - this is how we will greet our callers from <b>1 December 2008</b>.</p>

<p>More than just our telephone greeting is changing. As the <b>"Service Desk"</b> our tasks and responsibilities have increased, as has our range of services. To this end we have restructured within our support departments: four support / administration specialists have joined our team. This brings them  "closer to the customer" and they can respond more quickly to your queries in these areas.</p>

<p>As announced in <a href="http://newsletter.porscheinformatik.at/int_e/March_2008/">the March 2008 Newsletter</a>, our project represents a major step towards <b>ITIL</b>, the recognised "De facto standard" for IT enterprises (IT Infrastructure Library) - an important milestone.</p>

<p>From 1 December we will be using new, <b>more powerful software</b>, which will support us in all Service Desk processes (Incident, Problem, and Service Level Management) as well as the processes for Change and Configuration Management.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://support.porscheinformatik.com" target="_blank" title="" alt="">POI Online Support</a></b>, the Internet platform that you have been using for support queries (link to instructions), is also being replaced by this new application.
The description of the new Online Support can be found already via <a href="">Description Online Support</a>. Registered Online Support users will receive their access data via e-mail before deployment.</p>

<p>These measures will lead to further improvements and a greater degree of greater transparency efficiency for query processing.</p>
