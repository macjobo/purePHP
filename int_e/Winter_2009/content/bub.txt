<h1>IT Infrastructure: International Workshop</h1>
<h2>The first international Infrastructure workshop was held in Bergheim (Austria) on February 10 and 11.</h2>

<p>15 participants from 10 countries took advantage of the opportunity to inform themselves about current technology and discuss infrastructure topics at Porsche Informatik.</p>

<p><b><a href="index.php?page=hg2" title="Workshop">&raquo;&nbsp;Workshop</a></b> <b>focuses</b> include:</p>
<ul>
<div><li>new version of "Symantec" antivirus software</li></div>
<div><li>Wireless LAN</li></div>
<div><li>IT security</li></div>
</ul>

<p>All information and presentations regarding the workshop topics are available via our <b>POI Infoline</b> in Partner.Net (Betriebsführung - Standards - International).</p>

<p>This <b><a href="index.php?page=hg" title="cooperation model">&raquo;&nbsp;cooperation model </a></b> has been developed to further improve the exchange of information in infrastructure (clients, servers and networks).</p> 

<p>Due to the very positive feedback from all participants, we have already scheduled the next workshop for September. We look forward to your suggestions and recommendations!</p>
