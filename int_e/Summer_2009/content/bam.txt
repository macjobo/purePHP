<h1>CROSS: Welcome Terminal</h1>
<h2>The Service Welcome Terminal informs your customers on arrival at the dealership of the
details of their service appointments.</h2>

<p>A special CROSS interface reads <b>details of forthcoming
appointments</b> at regular intervals for display on a screen visible to the customer.
Customers are informed of the dealer's preparation for their appointments and a lasting 
impression of the dealer's <b>competence and professionalism</b> is made.
</p>

<p>Appointments shown on the <a href="index.php?page=bam_bild" title="Welcome Terminal"><b>&raquo;&nbsp;Welcome Terminal</b></a> are regularly updates - only forthcoming
appointments are shown. Appointments may be split by brand for display on different
Terminals and the <b>layout and design</b> of their presentation may be customised. 
</p>

<p>We are glad to answer your questions about details of technical requirements.
