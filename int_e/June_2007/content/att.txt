<h1>CARLOS in Hungary: Field report Porsche Hungaria</h1>
<h2>CARLOS the success story introduced in the Hungarian market with innovative extras</h2>

<p><b>Initial situation</b><br>

In 2004 PIT (Porsche Information Technologies) produced successful models in the "B" segment for the individual countries: CARLOS for the Austrian and Slovenian markets, NWGI for Hungary, IVDS for Rumania. All products were very successful and the most popular models in the local markets. However, back then it already made sense that centralised production would be better for the entire company. In segment "A" the successful CROSS model had already demonstrated this. After analysis  of the eastern markets the decision was made to consolidate the production of CARLOS and NWGI. The new product will also be known as CARLOS, as it is being built on the proven CARLOS platform.</p>

<p><b>Market differences</b><br>

A survey in the Hungarian market showed that, whilst the two models are driven by the same target group, the drivers have different styles in the two countries and the evaluation of functionality varies considerably. Additionally the legal situation is different, requiring certain parts of the vehicle to be produced in a different way. All of these problems can be resolved with national equipment (X4K for Hungary).</p>

<p><b>Product management</b><br> 

After signature of the consolidation contract, management rustled up a very strong team, which was given responsibility for product management and market introduction. Specialists from both countries ensured that the new model had all the premium functions of the two predecessors. Entire functions such as  IVF (Intelligent Varia Fields), LMX (Logistic Module eXtension) were inherited from NWGI. Thorough planning, intensive communication with the sales organisations, and also overtime and sleepless nights made possible the transition from a sketch to a driveable vehicle.</p>

<p><b>Market introduction</b><br>	 

Due to facelifts to the CROSS model - abbreviated to C2 - and the introduction of the  sporty VU2, the official market presentation was scheduled for February. This decision has shown very positive results, the introduction of the CARLOS to the market on 19.2.2007 PIT was once again a success. Central product training and test drives have ensured the acceptance of the sales organisation. The new model is as popular with drivers as good old NWGI, which is still being produced in Hungary for the Balkan countries.</p>  

<p><b>Further Product adaptations and accessories</b><br>

Minor changes have been made to the product functionalities as a result of feedback from the market, e.g. adjustable head restraints or the "Bonus package". We are still working on the standardisation of the instrument panel of the vehicle. Naturally, there are plans to take into account the market requirements of every country, all the time.</p>

<p><b>Future plans</b><br>	

With CARLOS, CROSS and VU, Porsche Information Technologies has a more successful  product palette for all segments of the automotive market than any of its competitors. The highly innovative extra, FAS (Full Action Support) function is available from calendar week 40 2007 for all countries. Consolidation of production for further countries is not only advantageous for the individual country, but will benefit the company as a whole. One area which might be improved is the reaction time for market requirements, but we are already about to begin improving this process.</p>
