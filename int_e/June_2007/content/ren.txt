<h1>SAP: Rollout Successful</h1>
<h2>SAP already in use for  accounting in 7 company countries!</h2>

<p>SAP has been used by Porsche since 1992. In 2004 Porsche Holding decided that the software successfully implemented in accounting in Austria should also be implemented as the <b>international company standard in partner countries</b>.</p>
<p>In recent years we have, as planned, in cooperation with the countries, <b>introduced the SAP system</b> in accounting for the following Porsche daughter companies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Retail Hungary</li>
<li>Wholesale Hungary</li>
<li>Eurent Hungary</li>
<li>Retail Czech Republic</li>
<li>Wholesale Slovakia</li>
<li>Retail Slovakia</li>
<li>Porsche Bank Slovenia</li>
<li>Porsche Bank Croatia</li>
<li>Retail Germany</li>
</ul>

<p>The following <b>projects</b> are currently being prepared for SAP implementation:</p> 
     
<ul>
<li>Porsche Bank Group Hungary</li>
<li>Retail Italy</li>
<li>Wholesale Slovenia</li>
<li>Wholesale Romania</li>
</ul>

<p>After these projects the next companies are already waiting for the planned switch to SAP.</p>	

<p>We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone involved, especially the contact persons and users in the companies, who contributed to the successful switch to SAP in accounting.</p>
