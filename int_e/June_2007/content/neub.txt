<h1>VU2: Support meets Support</h1>
<h2>Porsche Informatik is now offering a VU2 Support Workshop</h2>

<p>Porsche Informatik is offering a <b>VU2 Support Workshop</b> especially for the countries which are setting up their own VU2 support.</p>

<p>Basically, support requests generated in the countries should be resolved and responded to by the local <b>VU2 support team</b> (1st Level Support). Of course there are also support requests which 1st Level Support can not resolve. These requests are then sent via Online Support <a href="http://support.porscheinformatik.at">http://support.porscheinformatik.at</a> to our VU2 support team (2nd Level Support).</p>

<p>To <b>optimise VU2 support cooperation</b> between the support units in the partner countries and Austria, we are offering a workshop with the following content:</p>
<p><b>Theoretical part:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>POI support process and POI requirement management, as well as the supporting tools</li>
<li>Which tasks are handled by VU2 support and how is the support team structured?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Practical part:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up the VU2 environment for Austria and partner countries</li>
<li>Processing of typical support cases (Examples from partner countries and Austria)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Duration:</b> approx. 1.5 to 2 days, whereby the focus is on the practical part of the workshop
<br><b>Location:</b> Bergheim by Salzburg, Austria
<br><b>Language:</b> German, the workshop is available in English on request</p>

Interested? Then please contact Mr Michael Neubacher.
