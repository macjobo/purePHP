<p>The <b>high number of participants</b> (26 colleagues from 12 countries) demonstrates that this kind of cooperation and technical exchange is very well received. The strong interest encourages us to continue on this course.</p>

<p>The focus of this workshop were <b>server infrastructure topics</b> (operating system, virtualisation, hardware, etc.). The programme was rounded off with new client/desktop and network developments.</p>

<p>At the next workshop the technical aspects of the presented topics will be looked at in more detail. Your <b>responses to the questionnaire</b> sent out by Andreas Kronberger (Desktop Management) serve as the basis for topic selection.</p>
