<h1>Porsche Informatik: New Website</h1>
<h2>Porsche Informatik has a new Website - online since September - and now a matching redesigned Newsletter.</h2>

<a href="http://www.porsche-informatik.at/poi/en/" title="New POI Website" target="_blank"><img src="../images/bild_klb.jpg" width="190" height="120" alt="New Porsche Informatik Website" /></a>

<p>You may have noticed the new design of our Newsletter - it matches our <a href="http://www.porsche-informatik.at/poi/en/" title="New Porsche Informatik Website" target="_blank"><b>New Porsche Informatik Website&nbsp;&raquo;</b></a></p>

<p>On the one hand, we decided to update our Website because the <b>design</b> had become a little dated. On the other hand, we wanted to emphasize the <b>integrated process support</b> provided by Porsche Informatik systems for every car dealership process.</p>

<p>To this end we used <b>animations</b>, which automatically start when the page is accessed, and which can be accessed at any time by clicking on <b>Processes</b> on the bottom left of the page. Comprehensive product information about our most important <b>applications</b> and <b>services</b> can also be downloaded in PDF format.</p>


<p>Visit our website and browse the <b>overview</b> to learn more about our products and services.</p>
