<h2>At the end of October we successfully concluded the switch to Unicode, the second major SAP change of this year.</h2>

<p>In June the SAP system was updated to the latest release - ERP 6.0. Over the weekend from the 23rd to the 25th of October there was a further major change to the system: the <b>switch to Unicode</b>, which allows SAP to be displayed in additional languages.</p>

<p>These changes each concerned around <b>800 users in 10 countries</b> and the data of approximately 300 companies! Our comprehensive preparatory tests ensured that both transitions went smoothly and that no problems occurred. In total it took several thousand man-hours to implement the changes.</p>

<p>At this point we would like to thank the users who supported our testing and thereby made a <b>large contribution</b> to the successful implementation of these changes.</p>
