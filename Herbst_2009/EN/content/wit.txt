<p>In April <b>Slovenia</b> and <b>Kosovo</b> joined the CROSS landscape,  followed by <b>Serbia</b> at the beginning of August. CROSS is thereby now deployed in <b>13 countries</b>: Slovenia, Kosovo and Serbia as well as Austria, Hungary, Romania, Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Germany, Italy, Croatia and the Ukraine.</p>

<p>Currently CROSS is utilised by <b>over 800 dealerships</b> and approximately <b>11 000 users</b>. Our customers are clearly using a system that has proven itself at an international level and has succeeded against major competitors in Germany and Italy.</p>

<p>You are not only working with a renowned product, you also gain from the internationalisation of CROSS: many <b>functions</b> that were developed during the adaptation for new countries are then also deployed for other countries, most recently this was the case for CROSS activity management.</p>


<p>CROSS keeps our customer and us on the <b>road to success</b>!</p>
